### Rendering

To render this book in RStudio: Build tab > Build Book. Or on the command line:

```R
rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = 'UTF-8')
````

This will build the HTML and PDF versions of the book into the `docs/` folder, which should not be directly edited (and occassionally completely deleted before rendering to remove old unused files).
